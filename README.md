**Project Title** : Heart Disease Prediction

The Heart Disease Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model using logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of a patient having heart disease. By leveraging critical medical features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and smoking habits etc, the model seeks to provide accurate risk assessments.

The project involves gathering the dataset, preprocessing it to manage missing values and normalize features, and then applying logistic regression to pinpoint significant predictors of heart disease. The model is designed to offer clear, interpretable results to aid healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention. Ensuring the model's reliability and practical applicability, the project evaluates its predictive performance rigorously. Ultimately, this initiative strives to enhance patient outcomes through data-driven insights and informed medical decisions.

This model yields the output as,
[0] - The Person does not have a Heart Disease.
[1] - The Person have a Heart Disease.
